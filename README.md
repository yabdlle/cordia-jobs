# Cordia Jobs
Welcome to the Cordia-Jobs Bot, an innovative tool designed to streamline your job search by integrating real-time job data scraping with Discord notifications. This bot efficiently scrapes internship postings from a specified URL, providing users with instant updates and interactive commands such as ?jobs, ?swe, ?fullstack, ?it, and ?company to explore job opportunities.

Key Features:
?jobs: Fetch a list of recent job postings.
?swe: Retrieve job postings for Software Engineer roles.
?fullstack: Find job postings related to Full Stack and Frontend/Backend development.
?it: Explore IT-related job opportunities.
?company: Search for job postings from a specific company, with optional role filtering (e.g., ?company Netflix SWE).
The bot also features a ?recent command to highlight jobs posted in the last 48 hours and a ?commands command for a comprehensive list of available functionalities. With periodic updates every minute, the bot ensures you never miss out on new opportunities.

To get started, clone the repository, install dependencies, set up your Discord token in a .env file, and run the bot. For detailed information on commands, setup, and contribution, refer to the source code and documentation. Your contributions are welcome to enhance this project further. Happy job hunting!
